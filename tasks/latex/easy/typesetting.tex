\section{Fractions}
The following equation demonstrates how to typeset fractions in LaTeX:
\[
\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad + bc}{bd}
\]
This equation shows the addition of two fractions, where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are real numbers (with $b \neq 0$ and $d \neq 0$). The result is obtained by finding a common denominator and combining the numerators.

\section{Integrals}
The definite integral is typeset as follows:
\[
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx
\]
In this expression, $a$ represents the lower limit of integration and $b$ represents the upper limit of integration. The function $f(x)$ is integrated over the interval $[a, b]$, and $dx$ indicates that the integration is performed with respect to the variable $x$.

\section{Matrices}
A 2x2 matrix can be typeset using the following notation:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{bmatrix}
\]
In this matrix:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $a$ is the entry in the first row, first column
    \item $b$ is the entry in the first row, second column
    \item $c$ is the entry in the second row, first column
    \item $d$ is the entry in the second row, second column
\end{itemize}
Each entry represents a numerical value or variable that defines the matrix's structure and properties.
