# The Treasure

You swim to the heart of the wreck and find a golden chest! It’s shining brightly even in the murky water. You cautiously open it, half-expecting something terrible to happen.

Inside, you find not just gold and jewels, but a magical [key](key.md) to escape the Oceanic Abyss. Looks like you’ve won the game!
