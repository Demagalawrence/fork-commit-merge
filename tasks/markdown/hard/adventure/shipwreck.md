# The Shipwreck

You approach the sunken ship, which looks like it's been here for centuries. It’s mostly covered in algae, barnacles, and the occasional curious fish. A thick rope ladder dangles down into the wreck. The ship creaks ominously, but there’s a strange allure to it.

Suddenly, a shark darts past, glancing at you in a way that seems to says it will be returning for a second look. You swallow hard and decide to explore the wreck before any more potential companions swim by.

- Climb the [rope ladder](ladder.md) into the ship.
- Swim around the [wreck](wreck.md) to see if there’s anything valuable.
- Dive [underneath](treasure.md) the wreck and see what’s there.
