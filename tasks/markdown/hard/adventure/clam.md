# The Clam

You slowly swim past the octopus, trying not to provoke it and reach the clam. As you open it, you find a giant pearl! Not just a regular pearl. This one is glowing, and as you hold it, you feel a strange power surge through you. 

Suddenly, the clam snaps shut, trapping your hand. You panic for a moment, but then the octopus gently uses its tentacle to pry it open.

"Nice find!" the octopus says. "But you'll need that pearl for the next part of your journey. Youâ€™ll have to head [north](treasure.md) for that one!"

- With the pearl in hand, do you swim [north](treasure.md) towards what the octopus hinted at?
- Or do you thank the octopus and instead head [south](shipwreck.md) to see if there's anything in the wreck.
