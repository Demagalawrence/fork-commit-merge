# The Wreck

You swim carefully around the wreck. The ship groans and creaks as you pass by, and you can’t shake the feeling that something’s watching you. You find an old, rusty chest in the hold. You open it carefully, and instead of treasure, it’s full of exploding shellfish.

You are blasted away by a cloud of water and debris. You quickly try to swim back to safety, but your journey has come to an abrupt and painful end. Maybe next time you should stick to the clam.
