# The Grumpy Octopus

The octopus raises one of its arms and taps its tentacle against its chin. "Hmm, let me think..."
Then, with a dramatic sigh, it says, "Alright. I'll tell you. But only if you can answer this riddle."

You brace yourself.

The octopus grins. "What’s the ocean’s favorite type of music?"

- Answer the riddle with [rock](rock.md).
- Say [jazz](jazz.md), hoping it’s a good guess.
- Decline to answer and swim [away](reef.md).
