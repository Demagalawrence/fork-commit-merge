# The Coral Reef

You swim into a beautiful coral reef. The vibrant colors of the coral are almost mesmerizing, but there's something odd about the reef.... it feels like itâ€™s watching you. Suddenly, a large, grumpy-looking octopus appears from behind a rock. It stares at you.

"Hey, creature from above," it grumbles, "You lost, or are you just here to admire my tentacles?"

Behind the octopus, you see a large clam opening and closing. It looks suspiciously like it could hold something valuable.

- [Ask the octopus](octopus.md) if it knows the way out.
- Try to sneak past the octopus and [open the clam](clam.md).
- Leave the reef and [head south](shipwreck.md).
- [Swim north](reef.md) towards an even bigger coral formation.
