# The Magical Key

You hold the magical key in your hand. The water around you begins to swirl as if acknowledging your victory. You see a door made entirely of coral, with intricate carvings depicting ocean gods. The key fits perfectly into the lock.

As the door opens, sunlight bursts through, blinding you for a moment. You have escaped the Oceanic Abyss! The world above welcomes you with open arms, And also, a very confused fisherman.
