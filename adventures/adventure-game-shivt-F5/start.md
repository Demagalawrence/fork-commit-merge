You, a brave underwater explorer, have been swept away in a powerful current and found yourself in the _Oceanic Abyss_. You must navigate through an array of underwater creatures, coral reefs, and ancient shipwrecks to find your way back to safety—or discover something even more unexpected...

# Underwater Cave

You awake in a dimly lit underwater cave. The soft gurgle of water echoes around you as bioluminescent algae cast a faint glow on the walls. You have no idea how you got here, but you know you need to get out.

To your left, a school of fish is darting around an eerie coral formation. To your right, there’s an ancient sunken ship half-buried in the sand. A strong current flows from the [north](reef.md), and a dark, foreboding tunnel leads [south](shipwreck.md).

What do you want to do?

- Investigate the [coral reef](reef.md).
- Head towards the [shipwreck](shipwreck.md).
- [Swim north](reef.md) toward the current.
- Enter the [dark tunnel](shipwreck.md) to the south.
